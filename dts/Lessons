* Split your dts file so when kernel crashes you know the offending part. Also pay attention to sysfs size limits.
* i2c_arm is no longer a thing, it is probably left-over in the tutorial. Use i2c1.
* iio-hwmon can be included at any level, but must have access to the target phandle within the same overlay.
* iio-hwmon needs modification to support pressure, light intensity, magnet flux, etc., which are absent in hwmon types. Otherwise probing returns EINVAL.
* iio-hwmon needs to parse of_node in order to get io-channel-names.
